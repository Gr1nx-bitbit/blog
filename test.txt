Task #1: java -jar executable.jar

Task #2: documentation of commands. Some of the commands look just like the logic gates which is interesting.

statement in higher level programming?

Task #3: Give a description of what task3MIPSassemblylanguageprogram.s does in a file called task3desc.txt

Task #4: Submit in canvas :)
