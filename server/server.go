package server

/*
well, I called the package server but that doesn't mean much
for the blog I still have to come up with the design, how I
want it to look and what it'll be. honestly, the blog should be
an add on to just what my website is! My website should just
be a collection of the projects I've done and am trying to do.
This blog thing will just be something I can let thoughts out on
